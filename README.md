**Frontend Development**

I'm starting from the basics and working my way up to building complete, responsive, and interactive web applications.

This repository is my personal log of:
-  Notes and summaries from what I learn
-  Mini-projects to apply concepts
-  Bigger projects to showcase skills
-  Weekly progress updates
