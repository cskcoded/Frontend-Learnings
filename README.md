**Frontend Development**

I'm starting from the basics and working my way up to building complete, responsive, and interactive web applications.

This repository is my personal log of:
-  Notes and summaries from what I learn
-  Mini-projects to apply concepts
-  Bigger projects to showcase skills
-  Weekly progress updates


**ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ HTML Basics**

Concepts Learned:
- Basic HTML document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Links (`<a href>` with `target="_blank"`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`)
- Images (`<img src alt>`)
- Footer section

Mini Project Built:
- A simple Resume page with:
  - Name and photo
  - Contact information (email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub)
  - Education history
  - Skills list
  - Hobbies list
  - Footer with Â© notice

**Project Code:** [Day 1 â€“ Resume Page](https://github.com/cskcoded/Frontend-Projects/tree/main/Day1-Resume)  

## ðŸ“Œ Reflection
Day 1 was about getting comfortable with the basic building blocks of HTML.  
I now understand how to structure a web page and display information clearly.  
Tomorrow Iâ€™ll style this resume page with CSS to make it look professional.
